2. Axel Jeremy - 2201756140

**Dataset from:**

BINUS University

**Description:**

This is a program that can classify the quality of a wine based on a few categories, those are volatile acidity, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. StandardScaler and PCA with 4 components are used to do feature engineering. The model used for classification is Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and the output is the accuracy of model.

**How to Use:**
1. Open master.ipynb
2. Run all the codes

**Results:**

The model gets 52% accuracy:
